## About The Project

This project is created via proposed exercises in University of Helsinki's FullstackOpen program to develop a fullstack MERN web application with basic CRUD functionality. This project is derived from my exercise at [Part2: Phonebook](https://github.com/adrian-qorbani/fullstackopen/tree/main/part2/phonebook) and previous commits are pushed there.
