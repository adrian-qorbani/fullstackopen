# What is FullstackOpen?
FullstackOpen serves as an introduction to modern web application development with **JavaScript**. The main focus is on building single page applications with **ReactJS** that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on **GraphQL**, a modern alternative to REST APIs. Later courses shift their focus on subjects such as: **CI/CD** with Github Actions, **Containers** with Docker and **PostgreSQL**.
